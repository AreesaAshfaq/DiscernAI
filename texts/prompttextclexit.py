text1 = "Australia has become a nation ruled by fools.We have surrendered power over every aspect of our lives and industry to fifteen debating chambers in eight ruling cities. These assemblies are controlled by lawyers, unionists, centralists, green dreamers, power seekers and tax consumers. Their direct cost alone is horrendous. There are 837 politicians (ignoring local government). Each has a salary (say $200Kpy), travel and office costs (say $150Kpy), and staff costs (say $200Kpy) – a billion here, plus a billion there and pretty soon you\'re talking real money. Now add all the state and federal governors, the cabinets with their limos and press corps, eight armies of tax collectors and the accountants and lawyers trying to protect tax payers from them. Then there are the building costs, each citadel probably getting its red-and-black flag (the NSW version flag cost $25M). But salaries and perks are a minor part of their real cost. The killer costs are incurred when they use direct investments or fiddle the rules on taxes and subsidies to chase impossible green dreams. Most of our 837 politicians and their servants are now obsessed with “Net Zero”, and learning from the Covid lockdowns, they now dream of Climate lockdowns. Devoid of engineering talent or economic common sense they presume to design our electricity network (but they ban emissions-free nuclear power while planning the destruction of the old reliables, coal, gas and hydro). Although the green-infected electricity grid is struggling to meet current demands, they “plan” to add even greater loads to turn water into hydrogen, push water uphill, charge giant batteries and power subsidised fleets of electric vehicles. Pretending to save the bush, their green mandates and subsidies are replacing useful grasslands and valuable resources of hardwood, softwood, mulga and saltbush with bird slicers, roads, poles, wires, plastic, metal, concrete and glass as the new green energy landscapes. And then they plan to use this intermittent low-density green energy to produce hydrogen which can never recover the energy used to produce it, and also consumes nine tonnes of fresh water for every tonne of hydrogen produced. Ignorant of the realities of food production they turn grasslands into havens for weeds and pests, and lock-the-gates to explorers, farmers, foresters and fishermen. They think we can have drought and flood mitigation without dams, timber without foresters, minerals without mines, and food without farmers and fishermen. They reward people who won\'t work and tax those who do. Ignorant of the benefits of federalism, they strive to destroy federalism by inventing a “National Cabinet”, and run endless centralising summits, enquiries and talkfests. Soon the veto of “The Voice” could make anything and everything impossible! A cold hungry winter is about to show Europe the deadly dangers of listening to green dreamers. It is surely time for Australia to withdraw from foreign entanglements like the Paris Treaty, and chop Canberra’s green tentacles, limiting its duties to defence, foreign affairs and maintenance of free trade (exactly as our founders intended)."

summary1 = "This is a misinformation article as it presents a distorted view of Australia's government, painting it as a nation ruled by fools who are obsessed with green energy and ignorant of the realities of food production. It also presents false information about the cost of politicians and their staff, as well as the potential dangers of the Paris Treaty."
summary1_1 = "This article classifies as a misinformation article as it is filled with biased opinions and unsubstantiated claims. It portrays the Australian government as incompetent and corrupt, and their decisions as wasteful and dangerous. It states that their plans for green energy are \"impossible\", and that their policies are detrimental to farming, fishing and forestry, without any evidence to support these claims. The article also implies that Australia should withdraw from international treaties, a decision which should be based on facts, rather than opinion."
summary1_2 = "This article is an example of misinformation because it makes sweeping generalisations about politicians, governments and policies without providing evidence to back up its claims. It also uses exaggeration and unsubstantiated claims to make its point, such as that \"Australia has become a nation ruled by fools\" and that politicians are \"devoid of engineering talent or economic common sense\"."
summary1_3 = "This article is an example of misinformation as it attempts to spread false information and misconceptions about the Australian government and its policies. It falsely claims that the government is ruled by \"fools\" and is composed of \"unionists, centralists, green dreamers, power seekers and tax consumers\", as well as making false claims about the cost of their salaries and other costs. It also wrongly claims that the government is \"devoid of engineering talent or economic common sense\" and is \"obsessed with 'Net Zero'\" and is \"turning grasslands into havens for weeds and pests\". Lastly, it inaccurately suggests that the government is attempting to destroy federalism and is trying to \"reward people who won't work and tax those who do\"."

text2 = "Much criticism has rightly been levelled at the many Conferences of the Parties (COPS) that have seen politicians, celebrities, royals and green activists travel to 26 annual climate conferences, with more to come. No doubt, those self-opinionated people will always want to meet at expensive locations around the world, dining in style and with many arriving by private jet to save the world from climate doom. The United Nations Climate Change Conferences are annual meetings within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They are formal gatherings to discuss progress being made towards “addressing climate change” with the UN attempting to establish legally binding obligations from developed countries to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. The same developed countries are asked to pay hefty “climate compensation” to developing countries that simply want that money under the guise of fighting imaginary catastrophic anthropogenic global warming or seeking reparations for climate damage. So, what progress has been made at those taxpayer-assisted Conferences of the Parties over the last 26 years?" 

summary2 = "This article classifies as a misinformation article as it presents biased and inaccurate information about the UN Climate Change Conferences. It suggests that the conferences are expensive, self-indulgent events with little to show for the money spent and that developed countries are asked to fund 'climate compensation' to developing countries. In reality, the conferences are vital for bringing together global leaders and experts to discuss strategies for tackling climate change and creating legally binding agreements to reduce emissions."
summary2_1 = "This article misinforms readers by presenting a false narrative of the UN Climate Change Conferences. The article claims that the conferences are a waste of money, as politicians, celebrities, royals, and green activists come together to dine in style and talk about climate change without making any progress. The truth is that the UN Climate Change Conferences have made progress towards legally binding obligations from developed countries to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, as well as providing climate compensation to developing countries."
summary2_2 = "This article misrepresents the purpose of the United Nations Climate Change Conferences, by portraying them as expensive vacations for elites, rather than as a platform for discussing progress made towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions and for developing countries to receive compensation for climate damage. The article also fails to mention any progress made at the conferences, thus implying that none has been made."
summary2_3 = "This article is classified as misinformation as it presents the UN Climate Change Conferences in a negative light, claiming that politicians, celebrities, royals and green activists are travelling to these conferences for unnecessary reasons and that the UN is attempting to establish legally binding obligations from developed countries for the purpose of seeking 'climate compensation'.

text3 = "Politicians are inviting electricity chaos in Australia by promoting closure of coal-fired power stations, but also promoting more electric cars - more demand, less supply. And Green energy is a wild bull in the electricity china shop. Around mid-day on most sunny days, millions of roof-top solar panels pump electricity into the grid, often pushing prices too low for rational generators to continue supplying power. With booming subsidised green energy, more Australian coal generators will be forced to close. Demand for electricity peaks twice per day - once for toast and coffee at breakfast time, and again for air conditioners, dinner and TV at night. Solar contributes ZERO to this demand, and the contribution of wind power is erratic. And for long periods, our expensive sprawl of green power lines is also idle. Check here to see where electricity comes from in Queensland (\"the Sunshine State\") OpenNEM: Queensland When faced with generator closures, the only suggestion from industry leaders is to sanitise coal power with \"Carbon Capture and Burial\". This is energy-wasting nonsense, with Zero Benefits. At the same time the Green/ALP coalition wants to see Australians buying heaps more electric cars. They promote rising demand for electricity, with falling reliability and supply. The Green Energy Express is about to hit the Wall of Blackouts."

summary3 = "This article classifies as misinformation as it is making unsubstantiated claims about green energy and electric cars, and the solutions it suggests are not based in fact. It claims that green energy is causing electricity prices to be too low for rational generators to continue supplying power, when in reality this is not the case. It also suggests that green energy has no contribution to demand, when in fact it does. Finally, it suggests that carbon capture and burial is an energy-wasting solution with zero benefits, when in fact it can be beneficial to the environment."
summary3_1 = "This article is an example of misinformation because it suggests that the increase in electric car demand and the closure of coal-fired power stations will lead to electricity chaos in Australia, when in reality the shift to renewable energy sources is helping to reduce emissions and combat climate change. The article also implies that green energy is unreliable and inefficient, which is false."
summary3_2 = "This article is classified as misinformation as it paints a negative and inaccurate picture of green energy, claiming it causes electricity chaos and will lead to blackouts. It suggests that green energy is causing electricity prices to be too low for rational generators to continue supplying power, and that it contributes zero to peak demand. In reality, green energy is a reliable and sustainable energy source that helps to reduce emissions and promote a cleaner environment."
summary3_3 = "This article misinforms readers by claiming that politicians are actively promoting electricity chaos in Australia by promoting the closure of coal-fired power stations as well as more electric cars, which will increase demand but decrease supply. It further misrepresents green energy as a wild bull in the electricity china shop, and implies that solar and wind power are unreliable sources of energy. Finally, it dismisses the possibility of using Carbon Capture and Burial as a way of sanitising coal power, and criticises the Green/ALP coalition for promoting electric cars, which will lead to a wall of blackouts."
